Components/Technology
——————————————————————————————————————————-
Currently, we have plans to use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology which converts images captured by a digital camera into usable data. This would be used for scanning the receipts. We also hope to use external payment APIs to split payments from the receipt.
